                    <div class="clamping"><p>Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has invested a large amount of money into the construction of dams. In addition to power generation, dams were considered an important tool for water management during times of hardship. However, in recent years, dams have been at the crux of one of the country’s most serious environmental crises.</p></div>

If we exclude the approximately 5 million girls over 10 (“working age”) who are still in school, that leaves close to 18 million women, a disturbing number even if the situation has changed over the last year or so. And if it has changed, it’s of course possible that it has changed for the worse. </p></div>
